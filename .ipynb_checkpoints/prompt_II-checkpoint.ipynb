The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.  As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car."

    "#### Business Objectives\n",
    "Based on the available dataset, we want to determine what factors play the most significant role in determining the price that a customer is willing to pay for a given used car. In doing so, we hope to answer the question \"What factors should we focus on in regards to car inventory acquisition in order to improve revenue from used car sells?\"\n",

    "Taking the provided dataset as the current state of car inventory, business success criteria here can be described as \"if we were to focus on increasing inventory based on factors deemed most important to price, we should expect an increase in revenue performance\". That is, success of this analysis would be actionable insights that allow the client to make changes to their inventory strategy and ultimately lead to an improvement in used car sales."

    "#### Inventory of Resources\n",
    "Resources available for this analysis are quite limited. No personnel are available for feedback, and have only one iteration of static data available for analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Requirements, Assumptions, and Constraints\n",
    "In regards to resources, one of the major constraints is the limit of time. For this project, we have slightly under one week of time available, with the actual man-hours availible as a small fraction of this time period due to other previously agreed to committments to other engagements. As such, we will need to be very conservative in our choice of features to examine and in the time committed to model training. With this in mind, we should view this initial cycle of analysis as an MVP meant for the purpose of initial strategy assessment, with further cycles focusing more in-depth on identified key factors and allocating more time and resources as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In regards to the dataset available, we make the assumption that the data provided is sufficiently recent enough to provide an accurate image of the current state of inventory and its performance. Further, while the data entry process is unkown, we assume that minimal faulty data has been entered such that the data can be confidently relied on for accurate analysis.\n",

    "While the current revenue of the client is currently unclear at this stage, given that the dataset provided for analysis has over 400K cars and the original dataset had over 3 million cars, it is not unreasonable to assume a significant benefit from this initial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, [using the following article as a base of reference](https://www.sapling.com/12129768/much-money-average-used-car-dealership-make-year), if we were to assume annual sales of cars total about \\\\$3,900,000, a conservative number given the age of the data referenced in the article, and thus about \\\\$325,000/month, a 5% improvement in sales would result in revenue of \\\\$341,250/month, or an increase of \\\\$16,250/month. This more than justifies the cost of a rough initial analysis."
