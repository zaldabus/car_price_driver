    "In this application, you will explore a dataset from kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.  As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car."

    "\n",
    "#### Business Objectives\n",
    "Based on the available dataset, we want to determine what factors play the most significant role in determining the price that a customer is willing to pay for a given used car. In doing so, we hope to answer the question \"What factors should we focus on in regards to car inventory acquisition in order to improve revenue from used car sells?\"\n",

    "Taking the provided dataset as the current state of car inventory, business success criteria here can be described as \"if we were to focus on increasing inventory based on factors deemed most important to price, we should expect an increase in revenue performance\". That is, success of this analysis would be actionable insights that allow the client to make changes to their inventory strategy and ultimately lead to an improvement in used car sales."

    "#### Inventory of Resources\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Requirements, Assumptions, and Constraints\n",
    "In regards to resources, one of the major constraints is the limit of time. For this project, we have slightly under one week of time available, with the actual man-hours availible as a small fraction of this time period due to other previously agreed to committments to other engagements. As such, we will need to be very conservative in our choice of features to examine and in the time committed to model training. With this in mind, we should view this initial cycle of analysis as an MVP meant for the purpose of initial strategy assessment, with further cycles focusing more in-depth on identified key factors and allocating more time and resources as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In regards to the dataset available, we make the assumption that the data provided is sufficiently recent enough to provide an accurate image of the current state of inventory and its performance. Further, while the data entry process is unkown, we assume that minimal faulty data has been entered such that the data can be confidently relied on for accurate analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, [using the following article as a base of reference](https://www.sapling.com/12129768/much-money-average-used-car-dealership-make-year), if we were to assume annual sales of cars total about \\\\$3,900,000, a conservative number given the age of the data referenced in the article, and thus about \\\\$325,000/month, a 5% improvement in sales would result in revenue of \\\\$341,250/month, or an increase of \\\\$16,250/month. This more than justifies the cost of a rough initial analysis."

    "#### Inital Impressions\n",
    "Initial analysis reveals that the majority of features included as part of data are categorical. That is, values are within a predefined set of values. The features will need further encoding before they can be used for model training purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond these categorical features are four features with numerical values, **\"id\", \"price\", \"year\", and \"odometer\"**. **\"id\"** can be safely removed as it duplicates the function of the default index value with no added benefit. **\"price\"** is the dependent value and will need to be removed from the training data. **\"year** and **odometer** are likely to serve as good features for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unclear Features\n",
    "Initial examination of features leads to the conclusion that the provided features and their data are clear enough to understand what purpose they serve. More in-depth examination of data included per feature is required to see if there are any unusual/unclear values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing Values\n",
    "A number of features include missing values, with **\"size\"** missing the most with only 120,519/426,880, or approximately only 28% of registered cars including data. How to handle this missing data will require further investigation in order to answer questions such as \"why is this data missing\", \"what are common values for this missing data\", and \"can data be manipulated to fill in these missing values\". \n",
    "\n",
    "While it is advantageous to preserve as many data samples as possible, reducing to the minimum fully registered dataset of 120,519 would still represent a significant number of samples to train a model from, and as such leaves the initial impression that there is minimal risk of insufficient significant data."

    "- Manufacturer: Manufacturers with over 2% representation in dataset\n",
    "- Model: Top 100 models\n",
    "- Cylinders: Cars with 4, 6, or 8 cylinders\n",

    "- Title: Cars with \"clean\" status\n",
    "- Transmission: Automatic\n",
    "- Type: Cars with type count of over 500\n",

Given that this is likely a key feature in determining the price of a car and that no best guess assumption can be made for the non-null values, the course of action in this case is for rows with missing values to be dropped.\n",

    "With the above data cleaning, the final data samples will end up being around 34,147/426,880, or approximately 8% of the initial dataset. While this may seem like a small value, the absolute value is still significantly large such that we should be able to interpret the results of any analysis performed as a reliable model for car price. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further, it should be noted that this sample set represents the most common types of cars represented. As such, this should provide us with a solid foundation for determining an appropriate strategy for increasing revenue on the majority of cars sold by the client."
